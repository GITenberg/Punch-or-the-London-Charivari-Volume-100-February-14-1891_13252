    <h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Type Writer.</i>)</h4>

    <h3>No. XXIII.&mdash;THE TOLERATED HUSBAND.</h3>

    <p>It is customary for the self-righteous moralists who puff
    themselves into a state of Jingo complacency over the failings
    of foreign nations, to declare with considerable unction that
    the domestic hearth, which every Frenchman habitually tramples
    upon, is maintained in unviolated purity in every British
    household. The rude shocks which Mr. Justice BUTT occasionally
    administers to the national conscience are readily forgotten,
    and the chorus of patriotic adulation is stimulated by the
    visits which the British censor finds it necessary to pay (in
    mufti) to the courts of wickedness in continental capitals. It
    may be that among our unimaginative race the lack of virtue is
    not presented in the gaudy trappings that delight our
    neighbours. Our wickedness is coarser and less attractive. It
    gutters like a cheap candle when contrasted with the steady
    brilliancy of the Parisian article. Public opinion, too, holds
    amongst us a more formidable lash, and wields it with a sterner
    and more frequent severity. But it is impossible to deny that
    our society, however strict its professed code may be, can and
    does produce examples of those lapses from propriety which the
    superficial public deems to be typically and exclusively
    continental. Not only are they produced, but their production
    and their continuance are tolerated by a certain class,
    possibly limited, but certainly influential.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/73.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/73.png"
             alt="The Tolerated Husband." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Amongst these examples, both of lapse and of toleration, the
    Tolerated Husband holds a foremost place. Certain conditions
    are necessary for his proper production. He must be not only
    easy-going, but unprincipled,&mdash;unprincipled, that is,
    rather in the sense of having no particular principles of any
    kind than in that of possessing and practising notoriously bad
    ones. He must have a fine contempt for steady respectability,
    and an irresistible inclination to that glittering style of
    untrammelled life which is believed by those who live it to be
    the true Bohemianism. He should be weak in character, he may be
    pleasant in manner and appearance, and he must be both poor and
    extravagant. If to these qualities be added, first a wife,
    young, good-looking, and in most respects similar to her
    husband, though of a stronger will, and secondly a friend,
    rich, determined, strictly unprincipled, and thoroughly
    unscrupulous, the conditions which produce the Tolerated
    Husband may be said to be complete.</p>

    <p>The Tolerated Husband may have been at one time an officer
    in a good regiment. Having married, he finds that his pay,
    combined with a moderate private income, and a generous
    allowance of indebtedness, due to the gratification of
    expensive tastes, is insufficient to maintain him in that
    position of comfort to which he conceives himself to be
    entitled. He therefore abandons the career of arms, and becomes
    one of those who attempt spasmodically to redeem commercial
    professions from the taint of mere commercialism by becoming
    commercial themselves. It is certain that the gilded society
    which turns up a moderately aristocratic nose at trade and
    tradesmen, looks with complete indulgence upon an ex-officer
    who dabbles in wine, or associates himself with a new scheme
    for the easy manufacture of working-men's boots. An agency to a
    Fire and Life Assurance Society is, of course, above reproach,
    and the Stock Exchange, an institution which, in the
    imagination of reckless fools, provides as large a cover as
    charity, is positively enviable&mdash;a reputation which it
    owes to the fancied ease with which half-a-crown is converted
    into one hundred thousand pounds by the mere stroke of an
    office pen.</p>

    <p>The Tolerated Husband tries all these methods, one after
    another, with a painful monotony of failure in each. Yet,
    somehow or other, he still keeps up appearances, and manages to
    live in a certain style not far removed from luxury. He
    entertains his friends at elaborate dinners, both at home and
    at expensive restaurants; he is a frequent visitor at theatres,
    where he often pays for the stalls of many others as well as
    for his own. He takes a small house in the country, and fills
    it with guests, to whom he offers admirable wines, and
    excellent cigars. His wife is always beautifully dressed, and
    glitters with an array of jewels which make her the envy of
    many a steady leader of fashion. The world begins to ask,
    vaguely at first, but with a constantly increasing persistence,
    how the thing is done. Respectability and malice combine to
    whisper a truthful answer. Starting from the axiom that the
    precarious income which is produced by a want of success in
    many branches of business cannot support luxury or purchase
    diamonds, they arrive, <i>per saltum</i>, at the conclusion
    that there must be some third party to provide the wife and the
    husband with means for their existence. His name is soon fixed
    upon, and his motives readily inferred. It can be none other
    than the husband's rich bachelor friend, the same who
    accompanies the pair on all their expeditions, who is a
    constant guest at their house, and is known to be both lavish
    and determined in the prosecution of any object on which he has
    set his heart. His heart, in this instance, is set upon his
    friend's wife, and the obstacles in his way do not seem to be
    very formidable. The case, indeed, is soon too manifest for any
    one but a born idiot to feign ignorance of it. The husband is
    not a born idiot&mdash;he either sees it plainly, or (it may
    be, after a struggle) he looks another way, and resigns himself
    to the inevitable. For inevitable it is, if he is to continue
    in that life of indolence and extravagant comfort which habit
    has made a necessity for him. So he submits to the constant
    companionship of a third party, and, in order to be truly
    tolerated in his own household, becomes tolerant in a manner
    that is almost sublime. He allows his friend to help him with
    large subventions of money; he lets him cover his wife with
    costly jewels. He is content to be supplanted without fuss,
    provided the supplanter never decreases the stream of his
    benevolence; and the supplanter, having more wealth than he
    knows what to do with, is quite content to secure his object on
    such extremely easy terms. And thus the Tolerated Husband is
    created.</p>

    <p>It is curious to notice how cheerfully, to all outward
    appearance, he accepts what other men would consider a
    disaster. Before the world he carries his head high with an
    assumption of genial frankness and easy good temper. "Come and
    dine with us to-morrow, my boy," he will say to an old
    acquaintance, "there'll only be yourself and a couple of others
    besides ourselves. We'll go to the play afterwards." And the
    acquaintance will most certainly discover, if he accepts the
    invitation, that the "ourselves" included not only husband and
    wife, but friend as well. He will also notice that the last is
    even more at home in the house, and speaks in a tone of greater
    authority than the apparent host. Everything is referred to him
    for decision, and the master of the house treats him with a
    deferential humility which goes far to contradict the cynical
    observation that there is no gratitude on earth. The Tolerated
    Husband, indeed, never tires of dispensing hospitality at the
    cost of his friend, and though the whole world knows the case,
    there will never be a lack of guests to accept what is
    offered.</p>

    <p>At last, however, in spite of his toleration, he becomes an
    encumbrance in his own house, and, like most encumbrances, he
    has to be paid off, the friend providing the requisite annual
    income. One after another he puts off the last remaining rags
    of his pretended self-respect. He haunts his Clubs less and
    less frequently, and seems to wither under the open dislike of
    those who are repelled by the mean and sordid details of his
    despicable story. And thus he drags on his life, a degraded and
    comparatively impoverished outcast, untidy, haggard and
    shunned, having forfeited by the restriction of his spending
    powers even the good-natured contempt of those who were not too
    proud to be at one time mistaken for his friends.</p>

    <h3>TOMMY ATKINS'S HARD LOT.</h3>

    <p>"TOMMY ATKINS," writing modestly enough to the <i>Daily
    Chronicle</i> of the 6th February, complains that the coal
    supplied by the Authorities for barrack-rooms, is so limited in
    quantity that "during the winter this, as a rule, only lasts
    about two days" in the week, and TOMMY and his comrades have to
    "club-up" to supply the deficiency out of their own
    microscopical pay. "In fact" (says T.A.) "I have been in
    barrack-rooms where the men have had no fires after the first
    two days of the week." <i>If</i> this be so, <i>Mr. Punch</i>
    agrees with TOMMY in saying, "Surely this ought not to be!"
    TOMMY ATKINS may reasonably be expected to "stand fire" at any
    season, but not the absence of it in such wintry weather as we
    have had recently!</p>

    <p>"HERE WE HARE AGAIN!"&mdash;There are two Johnnies on the
    stage. JOHNNY Senior being J.L. TOOLE (now on his way home from
    New Zealand), and JOHNNY Junior, JOHN HARE, both immensely
    popular as comedians, and both in high favour with our most
    illustrious and judicious Patron of the Drama, H.R.H. the
    Prince of WALES. It is gratifying to learn that, after the
    performance of <i>A Pair of Spectacles</i> at Sandringham, the
    Prince presented the Junior of these two Johnnies with a silver
    cigar-box. In the right-hand corner of the lid is engraved a
    hare looking through a pair of spectacles, and inside is a
    dedication to JOHN HARE from ALBERT EDWARD. "Pretty compliment
    this," as Sir WILL SOMERS, the Court Jester, might have

    <h2>THEIR "IBSEN-DIXIT."</h2>

    <p>A new set of Faddists has been gradually growing up, not in
    our midst, but in the parts about Literature and the Drama. The
    object of their cult is, one HENRIK IBSEN, a Norwegian
    Dramatist, (perhaps it would be more correct to say, <i>the</i>
    Norwegian Dramatist,) of whose plays a pretty sprinkling of
    scribes, amateur and professional, but all of the very highest
    culture, profess themselves the uncompromisingly enthusiastic
    admirers. You may not know the Ibsenites or any of their works,
    but in their company at least,&mdash;that is, supposing
    yourself so highly privileged as to be admitted within the
    innermost circle of the Inner Ibsen
    Brotherhood,&mdash;<i>not</i> to know IBSEN would be proof
    positive of your being in the outer darkness of ignorance, and
    in need, however unworthy, of the grace of Ibsenitish
    enlightenment. Recruits are wanted in the Ibsenite ranks, so as
    to strengthen numerically the one party against the other; for
    the Ibsenitish sect has so for progressed as to be at
    loggerheads amongst themselves; not indeed on any really
    essential question, such as would be, for example, any doubt as
    to the position of IBSEN as a Dramatist, or as to the order of
    merit and precedence to be assigned to his works. No, on such
    matters they are apparently at one; but in other matters they
    are at one another. Thus the unity appears to be only
    superficial, a decent plaster hiding the rift occasioned by one
    of their number having literally translated into English
    IBSEN's latest Norwegian drama, of which translation the verbal
    correctness is impugned by another learned Ibsenite.</p>

    <p>Not being "a hardy Norseman," and having neither a reading
    nor speaking acquaintance with the Norse language, I am unable
    to decide abstruse points on which such learned doctors
    disagree; but not being altogether without some practical
    experience of English and French drama, I venture to call in
    question not only the dramatic ability of the dramatist
    himself, but also, after perhaps allowing him some merit as a
    type-writer or character-sketcher, to assert that the style and
    matter of most of his work is always tiresome, frequently
    childish, and the subject often morbid and unhealthy; and,
    further, that his method is tedious to the last degree of
    boredom; for, as a writer, if I may judge him fairly by his
    translators, he is didactic and prosy, and never more tedious
    than when his dialogue is intended to be at its very crispest.
    As a playwright his construction is faulty. Here and there he
    gives expression to pretty ideas, reminding me (still judging
    by the translation) of TOM ROBERTSON, not when the latter was
    in his happiest vein, but when laboriously striving to make his
    puppets talk in a sweetly ingenuous manner.</p>

    <p>I have never seen any play of IBSEN's on the stage, but I
    have read several of them&mdash;indeed, as I believe, all that
    have hitherto been translated and published in this country. I
    was prepared to be charmed, expecting much. I was soon
    disillusioned, and great was my disappointment. Then I re-read
    them, to judge of them not merely as dramas for the closet, but
    as dramas for the stage, written to be acted, not to be read;
    or, at all events, as far as the general public were concerned,
    to be acted first, and to be read afterwards. As acting dramas,
    it is difficult to conceive anything less practically dramatic.
    I do not know what the pecuniary result of his theatrical
    productions may be in his own country&mdash;where, I believe,
    he doesn't reside&mdash;but, out of his own country (say, here
    in London), I should say that a one-night's performance, with a
    house half full, would exhaust IBSEN's English public, and
    quite exhaust the patience of those who know not IBSEN.</p>

    <p>Years ago we had the Chatterton-Boucicault dictum that
    "SHAKSPEARE spelt failure." Now, for SHAKSPEARE read "IBSEN,"
    and insert the words "swift and utter" before "failure," and
    you have my opinion as to how the formula would stand with
    regard to IBSEN. I should be sorry to see any professional
    Manager making himself pecuniarily responsible for the success
    of such an undertaking, a word which, in its funereal sense, is
    of ill omen to the attempt. Let the Ibsenites club together,
    lease a theatre, and see how the public likes their show.
    There's nothing doing at the Royalty just now; let them pay
    rent in advance, and become Miss KATE SANTLEY's tenants; then,
    if the IBSEN-worshippers, with their Arch-priest, or
    ARCHER-priest, at their head, come to a temporary understanding
    with the Gosse-Ibsenites, they could craftily contrive to be
    invited as guests to a dinner at the Playwreckers' Club. The
    <i>dilettanti</i> members of this association the United
    Ibsenites could flatter by deferring to the opinions of their
    hosts, while inculcating their own, thus securing the goodwill
    and patronage of the Playwreckers, a plan nowadays adopted with
    considerable success by some of our wiliest dramatists, eager
    to secure a free course and be glorified; and so, by making
    each one of these mighty amateurs feel that the success of
    IBSEN in this country depended on him personally, that is, on
    his verdict or "<i>Ibsen dixit</i>," a run of, say, perhaps
    three nights might possibly be secured, when they could play to
    fairly-filled houses. One "nicht wi' IBSEN," one night only,
    would, I venture to say, be quite enough for most of us. "Oh,
    that mine enemy would write a book!" "Oh, that my enemy would
    bring out an Ibsenite play," and try to run it! Perhaps he
    will. In which case I will either alter my opinion or give him
    a dose of ANTI-FAD.</p>

    <p><i>BRAVISSIMO</i>, Sir ARTHUR SULLIVAN of Ivanhoe, or to
    compress it telegraphically by wire, "<i>Bravissimo
    Sullivanhoe!</i>" Loud cries of "ARTHUR! ARTHUR!" and as ARTHUR
    and Composer he bows a solo gracefully in front of the Curtain.
    Then Mr. JULIAN STURGIS is handed out to him, when "SULLIVAN"
    and "JULIAN"&mdash;latter name phonetically suggestive of
    ancient musical associations, though who nowadays remembers
    "Mons. JULLIEN"?&mdash;the composer and librettist, bow a duet
    together. "Music" and "Words" disappear behind gorgeous new
    draperies. "All's swell that ends swell," and nothing could be
    sweller than the audience on the first night. But to our tale.
    As to the dramatic construction of this Opera, had I not been
    informed by the kindly playbill that I was seeing
    <i>Ivanhoe</i>, I should never have found it out from the first
    scene, nor should I have been quite clear about it until the
    situation where that slyboots <i>Rebecca</i> artfully threatens
    to chuck herself off from the topmost turret rather than throw
    herself away on the bad Templar <i>Sir Brian de
    Bois-Guilbert-sans-Sullivan</i>. The Opera might be fairly
    described as "Scenes from <i>Ivanhoe</i>," musically
    illustrated. There is, however, a continuity in the music which
    is lacking in the plot.</p>

    <p>The scenic effects are throughout admirable, and the method,
    adopted at the end of each <i>tableau</i>, of leaving the
    audience still more in the dark than they were before as to
    what is going on on the stage, is an excellent notion, well
    calculated to intensify the mystery in which the entire plot is
    enveloped.</p>

    <p>The change of scene&mdash;of course highly recommended by
    the leech in attendance on the suffering
    <i>Ivanhoe</i>&mdash;from the little second-floor-back in the
    top storey of the castle tower, where the stout <i>Knight of
    Ivanhoe</i> is in durance, is managed with the least possible
    inconvenience to the invalid, who, whether suffering from gout
    or pains in his side,&mdash;and, judging by his action, he
    seemed to feel it, whatever it was, all over him,&mdash;found
    himself <i>and</i> his second-hand lodging-house sofa (quite
    good enough for a prisoner) suddenly deposited at the
    comparatively safe distance of some three hundred yards or so
    from the burning Castle of Torquilstone, in which identical
    building he himself, not a minute before, had been immured. So
    marvellous a flight of fancy is only to be found in an Arabian,
    not a Christian, Night's Entertainment.</p>

        </a>The game of "Becky my Neighbour." The Stout Knight lays
        low.
    </div>

    <p>The Tournament Scene is a very effective "set," but
    practically an elaborate "sell," as all the fighting on
    horseback is done "without." Presently, after a fierce clashing
    of property-swords, sounding suspiciously like fire-irons,
    <i>Ivanhoe</i> and <i>Sir Brian</i> come in, afoot, to fight
    out "round the sixth, and last." There is refreshing novelty in
    Mr. COPLAND's impersonation of <i>Isaac of York</i>, who might
    be taken for <i>Shylock's</i> younger brother who has been
    experimenting on his beard with some curious kind of hair-dye.
    This comic little <i>Isaac</i> will no doubt grow older during
    the run of the piece, but on the first night he neither looked
    nor behaved like <i>Rebecca's</i> aged and venerable sire, nor
    did Miss MACINTYRE&mdash;who, by the way, is charming as
    <i>Rebecca</i>, and who is so nimble in skipping about the
    stage when avoiding the melodramatic <i>Sir Brian de
    Bois-Guilbert-sans-Sullivan</i>, and so generally active and
    artful as to be quite a <i>Becky Sharp</i>,&mdash;nor, I say,
    did Miss MACINTYRE seem to treat her precocious parent
    (<i>Isaac</i> must have married very young, seeing that
    <i>Becky</i> is full twenty-one, and <i>Isaac</i> apparently
    very little more than twenty-eight, or, say, thirty) with any
    great tenderness and affection; but these feelings no doubt
    will be intensified, as she becomes more and more accustomed to
    her jewvenile father during the run of the Opera, and he may
    say to her, as the Bottle Imp did to his victim, "Ha! Ha! You
    must <i>learn</i> to love me!"</p>

    <p>I have not time to enumerate all the charming effects of the
    Opera, but I must not forget the magic property-harp, with,
    apparently, limp whip-cord strings, "the harp that once," or
    several times, was played by those accomplished musicians,
    <i>King Richard</i>, and <i>Friar Tuck</i>, the latter of whom
    has by far the most taking song in the Opera, and which would
    have received a treble [or a baritone] encore, had
    <i>Barkis</i>&mdash;meaning Sir ARTHUR&mdash;"been willin'."
    The contest between <i>Richard</i> and the <i>Friar</i> is
    decidedly "Dicky." Nor must I forget the magnificent property
    supper in the first scene, at so much a head, where not a ham
    or a chicken is touched; nor must "the waits" between some of
    the sets be forgotten,&mdash;"waits" being so suggestive of
    music at the merriest time of the year. Nor, above all, must I
    omit to mention the principal character, <i>Ivanhoe</i>
    himself, played by Mr. BEN DAVIES, who would be quite an ideal
    <i>Ivanhoe</i> if he were not such a very real
    <i>Ivanhoe</i>&mdash;only, of course, we must not forget that
    he "doubles" the part. There is no thinness about "<i>Ben
    Mio</i>," whether considered as a man, or as a good all-round
    tenor. I did not envy <i>Ivanhoe's</i> marvellous power of
    sleep while Miss MACINTYRE was singing her best, her sweetest,
    and her loudest. For my part I prefer to believe that the
    crafty Saxon was "only purtendin'," and was no more asleep than
    <i>Josh Sedley</i> on the eve of Waterloo, or the Fat Boy when
    he surprised <i>Mr. Tupman</i> and <i>Aunt Rachel</i> in the
    arbour, or when he pinched <i>Mr. Pickwick's</i> leg in order
    to attract his attention. But, after all, <i>Ivanhoe</i> and
    <i>Rowena</i>, as THACKERAY remarked, are a poor namby-pamby
    pair, and the real heroine is <i>Rebecca</i>. The Opera ends
    with a "Rebecca Riot." Every one wishes success to the new
    venture.</p>

    <p>As to the Music,&mdash;well, I am not a musician, and in any
    new Opera when there is no one tuneful phrase as in <i>Aïda</i>
    or <i>Tannhäuser</i>, which, at the very first hearing, anyone
    with half an ear can straightway catch, and reproduce next day
    till everyone about him cries, "Oh don't!" and when, as in this
    instance, the conducting-composer, Wagnerianly, will not permit
    <i>encores</i>&mdash;where am I? Nowhere. I return home in
    common time, but tuneless. On the other hand, besides being
    certain that <i>Friar Tuck's</i> jovial song will "catch on," I
    must record the complete satisfaction with which I heard the
    substantial whack on the drum so descriptive of <i>Sir Brian de
    Bois-Guilbert-sans-Sullivan's</i> heavy fall "at the ropes."
    This last effect, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
       id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> being as novel as it is
       effective, attracted the attention of the wily and observant
       DRURIOLANUS, who mentally booked the effect as something
       startlingly new and original for his next Pantomime. The
       combat between the Saxon Slogger, very much out of training,
       and the Norman Nobbler, rather over-trained as the result
       proved, is decidedly exciting, and the Nobbler would be
       backed at long odds. Altogether, the whole show was
       thoroughly appreciated by WAMBA JUNIOR.</p>

    <p>You are, let us say, a young professional man in chambers or
    offices, incompetently guarded by an idiot boy whom you dare
    not trust with the responsibility of denying you to strangers.
    You hear a knock at your outer door, followed by conversation
    in the clerk's room, after which your salaried idiot announces,
    "A Gentleman to see you." Enter a dingy and dismal little man
    in threadbare black, who advances with an air of mysterious
    importance. "I think," he begins, "I 'ave the pleasure of
    speaking to Mr.&mdash;&mdash;" (<i>whatever your name is</i>.)
    "I take the liberty of calling, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, to consult
    you on a matter of the utmost importance, and I shall feel
    personally obliged if you will take precautions for our
    conversation not being over'eard."</p>

    <p>He looks grubby for a client&mdash;but appearances are
    deceptive, and you offer him a seat, assuring him that he may
    speak with perfect security&mdash;whereupon he proceeds in a

    <p>"The story I am about to reveal," he says, smoothing a slimy
    tall hat, "is of a nature so revolting, so 'orrible in its
    details, that I can 'ardly bring myself to speak it to any
    'uming ear!" (<i>Here you will probably prepare to take
    notes.</i>) "You see before you one who is of 'igh birth but
    low circumstances!" (<i>At this, you give him up as a possible
    client, but a mixture of diffidence and curiosity compels you
    to listen.</i>) "Yes, Sir, I was '<i>fruges consumeary
    nati</i>.' I 'ave received a neducation more befitting a dook
    than my present condition. Nursed in the lap of haffluence, I
    was trained to fill the lofty position which was to have been
    my lot. But '<i>necessitas</i>,' Sir, as you are aware,
    '<i>necessitas non abat lejim</i>,' and such I found it. While
    still receiving a classical education at Cambridge
    College&mdash;(praps you are yourself an alumbus of <i>Halma
    Mater</i>? No? I apologise, Sir, I'm sure)&mdash;but while
    preparing to take my honorary degree, my Father suddenly
    enounced, the horful news that he was a bankrup'. Strip of all
    we possessed, we were turned out of our sumchuous 'ome upon the
    cold world, my Father's grey 'airs were brought down sorrowing
    to sangwidge boards, though he is still sangwin of paying off
    his creditors in time out of what he can put by from his scanty
    hearnings. My poor dear Mother&mdash;a lady born and
    bred&mdash;sank by slow degrees to a cawfy-stall, which is now
    morgidged to the 'ilt, and my eldest Sister, a lovely and
    accomplished gairl, was artlessly thrown over by a nobleman, to
    'oom she was engaged to be married, before our reverses
    overtook us. His name the delikit hinstinks of a gentleman will
    forbid you to inquire, as likewise me to mention&mdash;enough
    to 'int that he occupies a prominent position amongst the
    hupper circles of Society, and is frequently to be met with in
    the papers. His faithlessness preyed on my Sister's mind to
    that degree, that she is now in the Asylum, a nopeless maniac!
    My honely Brother was withdrawn from 'Arrow, and now 'as the
    yumiliation of selling penny toys on the kerbstone to his
    former playfellers. '<i>Tantee nannymice salestibus hiræ</i>,'
    indeed, Sir!</p>

    <p>"But you ask what befell myself." (<i>You have not&mdash;for
    the simple reason that, even if you desired information, he has
    given you no chance, as yet, of putting in a word.</i>) "Ah,
    Sir, there you 'ave me on a tender point. '<i>Hakew
    tetigisti</i>,' if I may venture once more upon a scholarly
    illusion. But I 'ave resolved to conceal nothing&mdash;and you
    shall 'ear. For a time I obtained employment as Seckertary and
    Imanuensis to a young baranit, 'oo had been the bosom friend of
    my College days. He would, I know, have used his influence with
    Government to obtain me a lucritive post; but, alas, 'ere he
    could do so, unaired sheets, coupled with deliket 'elth, took
    him off premature, and I was once more thrown on my own
    resources.</p>

    <p>"In conclusion, Sir, you 'ave doubtless done me the
    hinjustice to expect, from all I 'ave said, that my hobjick in
    obtaining this interview was to ask you for pecuniary
    assistance?" (<i>Here you reflect with remorse that a suspicion
    to this effect has certainly crossed your mind</i>). "Nothing
    of the sort or kind, I do assure you. A little 'uming sympathy,
    the relief of pouring out my sorrers upon a feeling art, a few
    kind encouraging words, is all I arsk, and that, Sir, the first
    sight of your kind friendly face told me I should not lack.
    Pore as I am, I still 'ave my pride, the pride of a English
    gentleman, and if you was to orfer me a sovereign as you sit
    there, I should fling it in the fire&mdash;ah, I
    <i>should</i>&mdash;'urt and indignant at the hinsult!"
    (<i>Here you will probably assure him that you have no
    intention of outraging his feelings in any such manner.</i>)
    "No, and <i>why</i>, Sir? Because you 'ave a gentlemanly 'art,
    and if you were to make sech a orfer, you would do it in a
    kindly Christian spirit which would rob it of all offence.
    There's not many as I would bring myself to accept a paltry
    sovereign from, but I dunno&mdash;I might from one like
    yourself&mdash;I <i>might Ord hignara mali, miseris succurreary
    disco</i>, as the old philosopher says. You 'ave that kind of
    <i>way</i> with you." (<i>You mildly intimate that he is
    mistaken here, and take the opportunity of touching the
    bell</i>). "No, Sir, don't be untrue to your better himpulses.
    <i>'Ave</i> a feelin 'art, Sir! Don't send me away, after
    allowing me to waste my time 'ere&mdash;which is of value <i>to

    <p>The Baron is delighted with MONTAGU WILLIAMS's third volume
    of <i>Reminiscences</i>, published by MACMILLAN &amp; Co. His
    cheery after-dinner conversational style of telling capital
    stories is excellent. He is not writing a book, he is talking
    to us; he is telling us a series of good things, and, quoth the
    Baron, let me advise you to light your cigar and sit down in
    your armchair before the fire, as not only do you not wish to
    interrupt him, even with a query, but you feel inclined to say,
    as the children do when, seated round you in the wintry
    twilight, they have been listening to a story which has deeply
    interested them&mdash;"Go on, please, tell us another!" The
    following interpolated "aside," most characteristic of MONTAGU
    WILLIAMS's life-like conversational manner of telling a story,
    occurs at page 8, where giving an account of a robbery, of
    which he himself was the victim, and telling how a thief asked
    to be shown up to his, the narrator's room, he says, "The
    porter, like a fool, gave his consent." The interpolated
    "<i>like a fool</i>," carries the jury, tells the whole story,
    and wins admiration for the sufferer, who is the real hero of
    the tale. But beyond the book's merit as an interesting and
    amusing companion, it contains some valuable practical
    suggestions for relieving the ordinary distress in the poorest
    districts which ought to receive attention in the highest
    quarters.</p>

    <p>To some readers interested in theatrical life, <i>Polly
    Mountemple</i> must prove an interesting work of fiction, if a
    story can be so styled which, as its author assures his readers
    with his latest breath, I should say in his last paragraph (p.
    291), "Is a true tale." It is the story of a "ballet lady" who
    rises in "the profession" to the dignity of a speaking part,
    and is on the point of being raised still higher in the social
    scale, and becoming the wife of a real live young nobleman,
    when she sensibly accepts a considerable sum of money, consents
    to forego her action for breach of promise, and finally marries
    a highly respectable acrobat, and becomes the landlady of the
    "Man of Kent." The earlier portion is entertaining, especially
    to those who are not altogether ignorant of some of the
    personages, sketches of whom are drawn by the author, Mr.
    CHARLES HOLLIS, with, it is not improbable, considerable
    fidelity. They are rough sketches, not by any means highly
    finished, but then such was the character of the original
    models. Before, however, it can be accepted by the general
    public as giving an unexaggerated picture of a certain sort of
    stage-life, it ought to have the <i>imprimatur</i> or the
    <i>nihil obstat</i> of some generally acknowledged head of the
    profession; for "the profession" is Hydra-like in this
    respect&mdash;a republican creation, with many heads.</p>

    <h2>THE HIGHEST EDUCATION;</h2>

    <h3><i>Or, what is looming a-head.</i></h3>

    <p>A Deputation on behalf of the Exasperated Ratepayers'
    Association waited yesterday afternoon on the Chairman of the
    London School Board at their new and commodious palatial
    premises erected on the vast central site recently cleared,
    regardless of expense, for that purpose in Piccadilly, and
    presented a further protest against the ever-increasing
    expenditure indulged in by that body. The Chairman, smilingly
    intimating that he would hear what the Deputation had to say,
    though he added, amidst the ill-suppressed merriment of his
    <i>confrères</i>, he supposed it was the old sing-song protest,
    possibly on this occasion because they had recently directed
    that the boys attending the schools of the Board should come in
    "Eton" suits, the cost of which naturally fell upon the rates,
    or some captious objection of that kind, which it really was a
    waste of breath to discuss. However, whatever it was, he added,
    he was willing to hear it.</p>

    <p>The Spokesman of the Deputation, a Duke in reduced
    circumstances, who ascribed his ruin to the heavy rates he had
    been called upon to pay through the extravagance of the Board,
    and who declined to give his name, said that though they had
    not thought the Eton suits a necessity, still it was not
    against them that they had to protest. It was the addition of
    Astronomy involving the erection (with fitting first-class
    instruments) of 341 observatories in the London district alone,
    Chinese, taught by 500 native Professors imported from Pekin
    for the purpose, horse-riding, yachting, and the church organ
    (these last two being compulsory), together with the use of the
    tricycle, type-writer, and phonograph, all of which instruments
    were provided for every single pupil at the expense of the
    ratepayers, to the curriculum of all those pupils who were
    fitted for the third standard. The speaker said he knew that it
    had long been settled that the finest and most comprehensive
    education that our advanced civilisation could supply should be
    provided for the submerged half of the population, and they
    could not grumble at these things, but what they did not
    consider necessary was, that a salary should be forthcoming for
    each pupil-teacher sufficient to enable him or her to drive
    down to the schools in their own carriage and pair. (<i>Much
    laughter.</i>) He did not think it a laughing matter. He would
    strongly suggest a diminution of at least £1000 a-year in the
    salaries of these overpaid officials.</p>

    <p>The Chairman here asked the speaker if he had considered
    that "descending" from a carriage was necessarily connected
    with the teaching of Deportment, on which the Board set great
    value? Was he not aware that some great man had said, wishing
    to give Deportment its proper weight as an educational factor,
    that the Battle of Waterloo (at least he thought he was quoting
    correctly) was won at Almacks? (<i>Renewed laughter.</i>)
    Anyhow, he did not consider that £2,500 a-year, and a house in
    Mayfair, was at all an excessive remuneration for a
    School-Board teacher, as measured by the Board's standard. He
    thought, if that was all the Deputation had to urge, that they
    might have saved themselves the trouble their protest had cost
    them.</p>

    <p>The Spokesman having for a few moments consulted with his
    colleagues, hereupon turned to the Chairman, and delivering
    with fearful emphasis the customary curse on the School Board,
    its Chairman, and all its belongings, at the same time thanking
    the Chairman for his courteous reception of the Deputation,
    silently and sulkily withdrew.</p>

    <h2>AN UPPER NOTE.</h2>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;I mustn't interfere with the diary of TOBY, M.P.
    But, as he is not reported as being in the Upper House on this
    particular occasion, I cannot help drawing general attention to
    the dispatch of business among the Lords on Thursday last. I
    quote from the Parliamentary Report in the <i>Daily
    Telegraph</i>, which informed us that</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The LORD CHANCELLOR took his seat on the Woolsack at a
        quarter-past four o'clock."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Then in came "A New Spiritual Peer." Awful! It sounds like
    an apparition in a blood-curdling ghost-story. Where was LIKA
    JOKO with his pencil? Well, "the new Spiritual Peer took his
    oath and his seat"&mdash;why wasn't he called upon for his
    toast and sentiment?&mdash;and then&mdash;what happened? Did
    their Lordships stay to have a friendly chat with the
    new-comer? No, not a bit of it; for the report says,</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Their Lordships rose at twenty-five minutes to five
        o'clock."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>So that, in effect, as soon as the new boy came in, and
    seated himself, all the old boys went out. There's manners for
    you! And this in the Upper House, too!! Yours truly, THE
    MARQUIZ.</p>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night, Feb.</i> 2.&mdash;"I do
    not," said OLD MORALITY, a cloud of disappointment settling on
    his massive brow, "know any case where, comparatively late in
    life, after a blameless career, depravity has so suddenly
    broken out in a man as it has with SYDNEY GEDGE. It is true,
    that upon occasion GEDGE has not given entire satisfaction to
    our friends opposite. They hold the opinion that his incursions
    in debate have been inopportune, and, in short, unnecessary;
    but that is their affair. We have had no ground for complaint.
    GEDGE has always voted straight, has appropriately filled up a
    dull half-hour when we had to keep a Debate going, and at all
    times he has invested our side of the House with a certain
    <i>je ne sais quoi</i> of dignity, combined with profound
    wisdom. And now to go and break out in this unexpected manner!
    It is incomprehensible,&mdash;would be, if I had not seen him
    with my own organs of vision, incredible. We must make GEDGE a
    Peer, or a County Court Judge."</p>

    <p>OLD MORALITY's discomposure not unwarranted. GEDGE certainly
    made our flesh creep to-night. Of all things in the world, it
    came about on the Tithes Bill. In Committee all night; Sir JOHN
    SWINBURNE spoken several times; HARCOURT, leading Opposition,
    made several efforts to inspire proceedings with a little life,
    but not to be done. Bill rapidly slipping through; Amendments
    to Clauses all disposed of; a few new ones on paper. Of course
    not slightest chance of being added to Bill. One by one moved;
    Minister objected; Clause negatived; and there an end of it.
    Twelve o'clock close at hand; on stroke of Midnight, Debate
    must be adjourned; still plenty of time to get the Bill through
    Committee. Everything out of the way except new Clause in name
    of SYDNEY GEDGE. But GEDGE loyal Ministerialist; not likely
    <i>he</i> would interfere with arrangements, and endanger
    progress of Bill. HICKS-BEACH, in charge of measure, kept his
    eye on the clock; three minutes to Twelve; running it pretty
    close, but just time to get Bill through. GEDGE on his feet;
    quite unnecessary; needn't stand up to say he would not move
    his Clause; if he had simply lifted his hat when Chairman
    called his name it would be understood that he had sacrificed
    his Clause. Dangerous this, dallying on stroke of Midnight.</p>

    <p>To his horror, HICKS-BEACH heard GEDGE beginning to describe
    purport of his new Clause. Was going to move it then? Yes.
    After moment's horrified pause, Ministerialists broke into
    angry cries of, "Divide!" Opposition convulsed with laughter;
    HICKS-BEACH pale and stern, and stony silent; SYDNEY GEDGE
    flushed, conversational, dogged. Even if Tithes Bill were lost
    he would explain the bearing of his new Clause. Scene
    increasing in hilarity; lasted three minutes: then Midnight
    sounded, and SYDNEY sat down, surprised to find he had talked
    out the Tithes Bill.</p>

    <p>"You might have knocked me down with a feather," said ALBERT
    ROLLIT, who, before opening his lips, had observed the
    precaution of propping himself up against the wall. "GEDGE, of
    all men, to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span> spoil the Ministerial plan,
       and imperil their arrangements for the week! It's all
       COURTNEY's fault. Since GEDGE tasted COURTNEY's blood, on
       the night he interrupted his speech by chatting in the Chair
       with HERBERT GARDNER, GEDGE has never been the same man.
       There's no knowing to what lengths he may not go."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;SYDNEY GEDGE broken out again
    worse than ever.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;MARJORIBANKS rather depressed as he
    rose to move his Resolution for appointment of Royal Commission
    on New Magazine Rifle. Had hoped to appear under very different
    circumstances. Meant quite to put in the shade LYON PLAYFAIR's
    historic lecture on Margarine, when he had the tables covered
    with pots of that substance, with penny loaves and small knives
    for Members to sample withal. For weeks MARJORIBANKS been
    preparing for occasion. Had possessed himself of quite an
    armoury of rifles: intended to bring them into the House and
    illustrate his lecture with practical experiments. The climax
    was to be the shooting-off scene. BOBBY SPENCER and ANSTRUTHER
    on in this. BOBBY standing at the Bar with an apple held on
    palm of extended right hand; MARJORIBANKS, using Martini-Henry
    Rifle, was to clear the apple off, leaving BOBBY's hair
    unsinged, and not a wrinkle added to his collar. ANSTRUTHER was
    next to stand in the same place, braving the fire of the
    Magazine Rifle. But he didn't have an apple, as it was arranged
    that the new arm should jam.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:18%;">
        <a href="images/84-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/84-1.png"
             alt="Standing Fire." /></a>Standing Fire.
    </div>

    <p>"Suppose it doesn't?" ANSTRUTHER inquired, when MARJORIBANKS
    first unfolded his scheme.</p>

    <p>"Oh, that'll be all right," said MARJORIBANKS, cheerily.</p>

    <p>Long practice on the Terrace made the arrangements perfect,
    when they were suddenly upset by interference from unexpected
    quarter. The SPEAKER, wondering what all this rifle-popping
    was, came to hear of the project; at once said it wouldn't do;
    no arms of any kind admitted in House of Commons, except the
    sword worn by SERGEANT-AT-ARMS, and once a year the lethal
    weapons carried by the Naval or Military gentlemen who move and
    second Address. BOBBY SPENCER rather glad, I fancy; ANSTRUTHER
    not inconsolable. But MARJORIBANKS distinctly depressed.</p>

    <p>"Not often I occupy time of House," he said. "We Whips make
    Houses, and you empty them. DUFF&mdash;and he's not a Whip
    now&mdash;made all the running with his orations on the herring
    brand. Thought I would make a hit this time."</p>

    <p>"I was a little afraid of it too," said ANSTRUTHER.</p>

    <p>"Oh, you were all right," said MARJORIBANKS; "the New
    Magazine Rifle will not fire unless, after first shot, you
    clean it out with an oily rag, and I was going to take precious
    good care to forget the rag. You've no public spirit,
    ANSTRUTHER, since you left us to help WOLMER to whip up
    Dissentients."</p>

    <p>No appeal from SPEAKER's ruling. MARJORIBANKS had to make
    the best of botched business. Brought to the table a spring
    snap-extractor, a bolt-head screw, and some other odds and
    ends; poor substitute for what he had intended. Still made out
    admirable case, Government mustering majority of only 34
    against Motion.</p>

             </a>Grandolph's Latest Achievement.
    </div>

    <p>Just before Midnight, Tithes Bill reached; GEDGE's Amendment
    still blocked the way; Chairman called aloud, "Mr. GEDGE!" no
    answer; place empty. Whilst Members whispering inquiry, Bill
    passed through Committee, and Ministers triumphed. That's all
    very well, but where's GEDGE? CORB, who is developing quite
    unsuspected gifts in the Amateur-detective line, intends to
    take this matter up when he has settled the affair of the
    Coroner at the BEDFORD inquest.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Tithe Bill through Committee.
    Mysterious disappearance of SYDNEY GEDGE.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday Night</i>.&mdash;GRAHDOLPH back again, bringing
    his sheaves&mdash;I mean his beard&mdash;with him. Hardly knew
    him at first. No such beard been seen in House since MACFARLANE
    left us. Not quite the same colour; but GRANDOLPH could give a
    handful to MACFARLANE, and win.</p>

    <p>"Yes," he said, when I complimented him on so magnificent a
    result achieved in comparatively short time, "when I do a
    thing, I like to do it well. Little awkward at first, you know,
    specially on a windy day; tendency to get between your knees,
    or wrap itself round your neck. But we're growing used to each
    other, and shall get on nicely by-and-by."</p>

    <p>More of Tithes Bill. Drearier than ever, now GEDGE's place
    is empty. <i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Report Stage of Tithes
    Bill.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Conversation as to course of public
    business. OLD MORALITY regrets Tithes Bill not through
    Reporting stage yet. Down on the paper for to-night, but didn't
    think there would be much chance of reaching it. So put it down
    for Monday. If not got through then, must be taken on Thursday,
    and JOHN MORLEY's Resolution on Crimes Act shunted along
    indefinitely. Much regretted this; duty to Queen and Country,
    &amp;c.; but no one had yet discovered the secret of inclosing
    a quart of fluid matter in a glass receptacle not exceeding the
    capacity of one pint.</p>

    <p>Members thus informed that Tithes Bill was taken off
    <i>agenda</i> for to-night, went off; House emptied; and when,
    at quarter-past Seven, CONYBEARE rose to discuss Mining
    Royalties, was Counted Out.</p>

    <p>"Why, bless me!" cried OLD MORALITY, aghast at the news,
    "here's a sitting practically wasted, and we might have used it
    for the Tithes Bill." <i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Motion to
    abolish Livery Franchise negatived by 148 votes against
    120.</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
